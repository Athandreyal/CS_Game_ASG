/*
    Collision expects the current frame to be up to date, double buffering means the current frame is one update out of date.
    
    double buffering messes with pos and lastPos.
    double buffering results in pos, and lastPos2 being local, and lastPos being on the other buffer
        -this means the LW and collision will be out of step
    I am expecting unrender to undo lastPos, unrender must undo lastPos2 now

    
    I am expecting the LW to be drawn between LP2 and LP1, but these are not on the same buffer, problems result;
        -LW expected to be one step behing the player.
        -LW should draw last TWO wall segments on each call.
        -LP3 is now required.
    
    the above ~should~ correct for double buffering.
