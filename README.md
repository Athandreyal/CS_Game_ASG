# Game Specification [ __Tron - LightCycle__]
-----------------------------

## General Game Overview
=============================

Tron – light cycle is a 2D territory claiming skill based racing game. 
The aim is to survive longest within the confines of the playing field 
while also interfering with the survival/play of the competing player.
 
Play is controlled via the WASD keys or the arrow keys (user preference) 
each player directly controls a “lightcycle” that can move up,down,left and right
 within the rectangular playing field. 

For both players any movement 
is trailed by a “light wall” with collision, if either player comes into 
contact with either the field wall, their own light wall or the opposing
 players light wall, they have died and the opposing player win.

Gameplay is primarily two player, however there will also be a single person 
timed training mode to allow for practice in this highly skill based game.
